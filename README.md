This project showcases a very basic website setup through use of a main index page that directs to several subpages for individual recipes. Folders are created to house the recipe pages and images for the website. Individual pages will demonstrate basic HTML page structure using <!DOCTYPE>, &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, and other elements. Page content will be displayed using header, paragraph, image, and unordered and ordered list elements.
